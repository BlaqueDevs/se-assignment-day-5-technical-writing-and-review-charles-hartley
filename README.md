Language & Terminology - Tech experts use precise technical terms. Non-Experts simplify concepts with analogies.
Depth of Explanation - Tech Experts provide in depth details, assume prior knowledge. Non-Experts focus on what it does not how it works.
Presentation style - Tech experts use code snippets, diagrams and documentation. Non-experts uses visuals, step by step guides and real-world examples.
Focus on benefits vs mechanics - Tech experts highlight customizability, integrations and performance metrics. Non-experts emphasize ease of use, automation and problem-solving.

Best for: Statistics, performance metrics, market trends
Network & System Architecture → Diagrams
Example: Cloud Infrastructure Setup
Best for: Networking, software architecture, API interactions
## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
